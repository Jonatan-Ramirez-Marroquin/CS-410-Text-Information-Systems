# CS-410-Text-Information-Systems
Course Project for CS 410 - Text Information Systems.
Group project where we proposed improvements of the UI and overall feel of the LiveDataLab platform. We provided an overall consistent UI and additions to the home page. Most of our work went to replicating the overall look of the website, as we did not receive documentation or access to files we were intially promised.
Our group provided a demo video of how the website works via a React environment we had to set up on our machines. Our documentation is under the src folder -> pages folder in which we added our individual page contributions, mine being: manage, courses, and coursesPage.
